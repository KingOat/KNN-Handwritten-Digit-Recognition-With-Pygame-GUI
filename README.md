# KNN Handwritten Digit Recognition with Pygame Interface

This is a machine learning application that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits. It is implemented in Python using Keras, a popular deep learning framework, and features a user-friendly Pygame interface for inputting and recognizing digits.

## Features

- Real-time recognition of handwritten digits using KNN algorithm
- User-friendly Pygame interface for drawing or inputting digits
- Provides immediate feedback on recognized digits
- Uses a pre-trained KNN model for classification

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip` or `conda`:

```bash
pip install numpy keras pygame
